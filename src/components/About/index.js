        My name is Kristin Earnest and I am currently an employee at Anthem/Aspire Healthcare. With my current position I have advanced three times and I am now a Care Coordinator III. My daily tasks are scheduling my five providers visits for their weekly follow ups, manage all activity on each individualâ€™s calendar, follow up with each patient after a hospitalization or rehab stay, assist with training new colleagues, and sales experience/enrolling new patients to service. While here at Aspire Healthcare, I was awarded the Aspire for Greatness award by my Clinical Director for my stewardship, team work, compassion and going the extra mile while starting up the Atlanta market.
